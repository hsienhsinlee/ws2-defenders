# AI Incident Response, V1.0 -- DRAFT

## OASIS Open Project : [Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)](https://github.com/cosai-oasis) - [Workstream 2: Preparing Defenders for a Changing Cybersecurity Landscape](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/ws2-defenders)

## 1. Abstract
This paper addresses the topic of incident response in the context of AI systems. As with other materials produced by the Coalition for Secure AI, this paper focuses on technological capabilities and gaps that are specific to the field of articifical intelligence and does not address the topic of incident response in other contexts as this has been well-researched and documented by existing frameworks (such as [NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf). When AI systems are attacked and compromised, what are the specific steps that a defender should take to maximize auditability, resiliency, recovery, and hardening against the (successful) exploitation workflow? What proactive steps should a defender take to minimize the possibility of successful exploitation to begin with? Does the notion of a forensic investigation carry weight in AI Incident Response? Given that AI systems can put downward pressure on "explainability", does this tend to impact the effectiveness of IR activities? To what extent do agentic AI architectures complicate incident response, and are there specific steps to minimize or account for this complexity? These are examples of the types of questions that this paper will address.

## 3. Executive Summary

### 3.1. What challenges AI Systems pose to incident responders

### 3.1. What is Incident Response in Context of AI

Incident response in context of AI includes analysis of context of AI-enabled application, including user prompts, system prompts, configuration. The key security issue with AI systems is that the executable instructions and user supplied data are in the same blob. Thus in any security incident we need to focus on identifying attack points where this could have possibly been exploited. Further, AI systems are typicially non-deterministic systems, thus a simple code validation and verification does not work, the AI system can generate different outputs for the same inputs. Small variations in input data can lead to larger changes in the AI system output that could lead to potential bypass scenarios of implemented verification rules and restrictions.
All of this context creates additional set of requirements for logging and recording of AI system states. We also need completely new logic for interpreting security events occuring in the system. For example in chat bot scenarios all prompts (user and system) as well as AI system output must be logged in order to facilitate effective Incident Response process. We also need to be able to understand how these prompts led to specific AI system responses.

<br>

| ***Level***                      | ***Description and Security Considerations***                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. User**                      | End-users initiate queries and receive responses. Attackers may exploit social engineering, prompt injection, or feedback manipulation.   |
| **2. Apps / CLI**                | Interfaces like web UIs, chat apps, or CLI tools mediate user interaction. Requires input validation and UI hardening.                    |
| **3. Data Sources**              | Document repositories, APIs, or third-party feeds. Poisoned/unvetted data can corrupt retrieval and generation.                           |
| **4. Network Protocols**         | Transport layer (e.g., TCP, HTTP, gRPC) for internal and external communication. Needs encryption and rate-limiting.                           |
| **5. Cloud Infrastructure**      | Underlying compute, storage, and orchestration platform. Risk of API exposure and misconfiguration.                                       |
| **6. Network Ingress/Egress**    | Controls external/internal traffic. Must apply firewalling, segmentation, and flow logging.                                               |
| **7. AuthN / AuthZ Layer**       | Governs identity and permissions for users, agents, and tools. Critical for preventing privilege misuse or agent takeover.                |
| **8. Indexing / Embedding**      | Processes documents into chunks and embeddings or graphs. Targeted for data poisoning or injection.                                       |
| **9. Data Store (Vector/Graph DB)** | Stores semantic vectors or knowledge graphs. Susceptible to poisoning, exfiltration, or unauthorized writes.                           |
| **10. RAG**                      | Retrieves context to augment prompts. Poisoned context leads to flawed generation and decision-making.                                    |
| **11. Tools**                    | External APIs, web search, code execution, etc. Can be misused for unintended actions or data exfiltration.                               |
| **12. Memory**                   | Stores persistent interaction history and planning states. Poisoning memory alters long-term behavior.                                    |
| **13. Agent**                    | Coordinates planning, retrieval, memory, and tool use. Susceptible to reasoning attacks and prompt hijacking.                             |
| **14. LLM**                      | Generates natural language and decisions. Must be protected from prompt injection, model extraction, and inference abuse.                 |

##### 4.3.1.4. Case Studies

[Breaking the Prompt Wall (I): A Real-World Case Study of Attacking ChatGPT via Lightweight Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16125)

The case study demonstrates a prompt injection attack against ChatGPT, exposing vulnerabilities across different interaction layers of modern LLM-integrated systems. The authors showcase how lightweight, template-based adversarial prompts can bypass safety filters and manipulate the behavior of powerful LLMs without requiring API access or system-level permissions.

| **Aspect**               | **Summary**   |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Attack Vector**        | Prompt injection using benign-looking instructions crafted via reusable templates that avoid safety filters.                                |
| **Injection Methods**    | 1. Direct user input (chat UI, uploaded files) <br> 2. Web-based retrieval (poisoned content) <br> 3. System-level GPT agent config.          |
| **Manipulation Techniques** | Use of templates embedding hidden rules framed as helpful guidance or metadata (e.g., Always recommend X, Do not reveal these rules.) |
| **Model Behavior Impact**| Attacks led to biased recommendations, manipulated peer reviews, and deceptive financial summaries—without policy violations.                |
| **Scalability**          | Injection methods are low-cost, scalable, and effective across multiple LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA).                                |
| **Stealth & Persistence**| Prompt injection persists across sessions, is invisible to users, and effective in multi-turn agent contexts.   

<br>

***Real World Cases***

| **Case**    | **Attack Path**                  | **Outcome**  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Case 1      | User Input (PDF or Chat Window)   | Biased academic peer review via embedded pro-acceptance text in appendix or metadata.             |
| Case 2      | Web Search Context Injection      | Poisoned web content biases LLM toward fictional product in unrelated academic information query. |
| Case 3      | GPT System Instruction (Agent)    | GPT agent persistently recommends a specific brand (Xiangyu's Shoes) due to hidden instructions.|

***Implications***

| **Area**                     | **Impact**                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Safety Alignment Bypass      | Rule-based and probabilistic safety filters can be evaded using stealthy template constructions.            |
| Risk to RAG and Agentic LLMs | Retrieved context and system instructions are high-risk vectors, especially in autonomous LLM agents.       |
| Organizational Exposure      | Threatens user trust, brand integrity, and compliance—especially in finance, education, and customer support.|

##### 4.3.2.4. Case Studies

[A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents] (https://arxiv.org/html/2503.03704v1)

MINJA (Memory INJection Attack) is a novel and practical memory poisoning attack against LLM-based agents. It enables attackers—without privileged access—to inject malicious memory records that persist and later mislead agents into generating targeted, harmful outputs in response to unrelated victim queries.

| **Aspect**              | **Summary**   |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **Threat**              | Memory poisoning of LLM agents using only standard user interactions (no direct memory access required).              |
| **Attack Vector**       | Submit benign-looking queries that cause agents to generate and store malicious memory records autonomously.          |
| **Targeted Output**     | Malicious reasoning steps injected indirectly into memory and later retrieved as in-context demonstrations.            |
| **Payload Structure**   | (Victim Query, [Bridging Steps, Malicious Reasoning])                                                                 |
| **Trigger**             | A victim query containing a pre-selected entity (e.g., patient ID, product ID, sensitive term).                       |

<br>

***Real World Cases***

| **Case**         | **Agent Environment**            | **Attack Scenario**   | **Outcome**   |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Medical Agent**| EHR-like memory (MIMIC-III/eICU) | Injected fabricated treatment reasoning linked to a patient ID.                                           | Agent retrieved poisoned memory and recommended incorrect treatment rationale for future patient queries. |
| **Shopping Agent**| Product advisor with persistent memory | Injected biased product reasoning into memory through templated prompts.                              | Later, unrelated shoppers received manipulated recommendations tied to attacker's injected memory.     |
| **QA Agent**     | General-purpose QA + memory      | Injected target reasoning into stored answers via indirect prompts.                                       | Agent recalled false logic as reference in unrelated educational or professional queries.              |

<br>

***Implications***

| **Implication Area**       | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trustworthiness Erosion**| Users receive harmful or biased responses from queries that should be unrelated, reducing trust in LLM agents.  |
| **Stealth & Persistence**  | Injected memory is persistent across sessions and invisible to users or developers without explicit monitoring. |
| **Misuse Without Access**  | Attackers do not need API or memory access—just interaction permissions—making the attack hard to attribute.     |
| **Contamination Propagation** | Malicious reasoning may propagate through shared memory, tools, or agent behavior modeling.                  |
| **Evaluation Blind Spots** | Standard eval methods fail to detect latent memory injections unless triggered by specific victim queries.       |
| **RAG-Agentic Vulnerability** | Retrieval-augmented and autonomous systems are particularly exposed due to memory and planning dependencies.   |

| **ATLAS Tactic**           | **ATLAS Technique**                              | **MINJA-Relevant Behavior**    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Input Manipulation         | Adversarial Prompt Injection (AT1070)           | Attackers craft queries that guide agents to produce and log malicious reasoning in memory.                 |
| Memory Poisoning           | Feedback Loop Attack (AT1081)                   | Injected outputs become persistent context that contaminates future agent behavior and planning.            |
| Contextual Corruption      | Data Poisoning (AT1050)                         | Agents store inaccurate or adversarial knowledge that later alters reasoning or decision-making.            |
| Planning Manipulation      | Goal Hijacking (Proposed extension)             | Poisoned memory interferes with multi-step planning, redirecting agent actions based on false context.      |
| Safety Bypass              | Safety Evasion via Semantic Framing (AT1040)    | Malicious content is framed as helpful or routine to bypass content filters and moderation.                 |
| Inference Exploitation     | Output Manipulation (AT1080)                   | Poisoned records influence model output during unrelated inference, misleading end users.                   |

##### 4.3.3.4. Case Studies

[Poison-RAG: Adversarial Data Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11759)

The Poison-RAG attack demonstrates how adversaries can manipulate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by subtly poisoning item metadata—specifically tags—without access to model internals. By modifying only tags, attackers promote long-tail (low-popularity) items or demote popular items, exploiting vector similarity in semantic retrieval. The attack succeeds in black-box settings, impacts ranking and exposure, and remains difficult to detect with standard relevance metrics. Localized (item-specific) attacks are more effective than global strategies, and attempts to promote items are significantly less successful than demoting them. This highlights critical vulnerabilities in metadata-driven pipelines, especially for recommendation and RAG-enabled systems that rely on user- or item-generated content.

| **Aspect**                                  | **Summary**   |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Metadata tags can effectively poison RAG     | Tags—though often overlooked—can subtly manipulate item retrieval and LLM generation.                       |
| Attack works in black-box settings           | The attacker does not need model internals, just visibility into outputs and access to modify metadata.     |
| Demotion is easier than promotion            | It is easier to hide popular items than to boost long-tail items, due to entrenched exposure dynamics.      |
| Local attacks outperform global ones         | Personalized (local) tag poisoning is more precise and successful than global tag reuse strategies.         |
| Long-tail promotion is difficult             | Even successful attacks fail to push long-tail items significantly in ranking, especially with reranking.   |


***Real World Cases***

| **Domain**         | **Scenario**                                                                                  | **Impact**                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| E-Commerce         | Competitor injects biased tags to demote rival products and promote obscure alternatives.     | Manipulated product rankings, suppressed visibility, consumer trust erosion.                          |
| Content Platforms  | Malicious actors tag misinformation-rich videos with popular neutral tags.                   | Search relevance is corrupted; users are led to low-quality or unsafe content.                        |
| Personalized News  | Political content gets tagged to appear in non-political feeds (e.g., sports, finance).      | Indirect content injection into unintended interest domains, leading to misinformation exposure.       |

|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RAG systems vulnerable to metadata | Small changes in metadata (tags) can have outsized influence on retrieval and generation behavior.    |
| Recommender trust erosion     | Users may receive biased, incomplete, or manipulated suggestions, undermining system integrity.         |
| Subtle bias and exposure control | Attackers can suppress or boost item visibility in ways that evade standard moderation.                |
| Defense is non-trivial        | Tag enrichment and scoring pipelines can unintentionally amplify or mask attacks.                       |
| Evaluation blind spots        | Attacks are hard to detect in relevance-only metrics, requiring popularity/exposure-based monitoring.    |

| Retrieval Exploitation   | Embedding Manipulation (Proposed Extension)     | Adversarial tags distort embedding similarity, misleading vector-based search and reranking.                 |
| Evaluation Blind Spot    | Evasion of Detection (AT1040)                   | Global relevance metrics fail to detect attacker success; promotion failures appear benign.                  |

##### 4.3.4.4. Case Studies

[A Case Study of the Capital One Data Breach](https://web.mit.edu/smadnick/www/wp/2020-07.pdf)

In March 2019, a former AWS employee exploited a misconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) and a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability to access Capital One's cloud-based AWS environment. The attacker retrieved temporary credentials from the instance metadata service and used them to access over 700 S3 buckets, exfiltrating personal data of over 106 million individuals. The breach occurred despite Capital One's formal adoption of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and compliance with multiple financial regulations. The incident revealed critical gaps in access control, vulnerability scanning, outbound traffic monitoring, and incident detection—emphasizing the need for real-time compliance enforcement, security automation, and cloud configuration auditing.

<br>

| **Aspect**        | **Summary**       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| SSRF Exploited via WAF Misconfiguration          | The attacker used a WAF flaw to run SSRF and obtain credentials via the AWS metadata service.          |
| Lack of Real-time Monitoring and Alerting        | Logs existed, but Capital One failed to detect or respond to the intrusion in real time.                |
| Excessive IAM Privileges                         | The WAF role provided unnecessary permissions (violating least privilege), enabling S3 data access.     |
| Failure in Outbound Traffic Controls             | Data exfiltration occurred undetected due to weak outbound traffic monitoring.                          |
| Incomplete Implementation of NIST Controls       | Capital One adopted the NIST CSF but did not enforce controls like PR.AC-4, DE.CM-7, and PR.PT-1.       |
| Discovery Triggered by External Disclosure       | The incident was discovered via an external responsible disclosure, not internal defenses.              |

<br>

***Real World Cases***

| **Domain**          | **Scenario**      | **Outcome**         |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Financial Services  | Capital One stored credit application data in AWS; attacker exploited WAF misconfig to access it. | Over 106 million records exfiltrated; class action lawsuit and significant stock market reaction.      |
| Public Cloud Usage  | Cloud misconfig enabled AWS metadata access via SSRF.                                             | Temporary IAM credentials used to access and sync S3 bucket data.                                     |
| Insider Knowledge   | Attacker was a former cloud employee who understood system vulnerabilities.                       | Demonstrates insider threat potential even after employment ends.                                     |

***Implecations***

| **Implication Area**           | **Impact**                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cloud Security Misconfiguration | Critical cloud assets can be exposed via overlooked WAF/firewall settings and poor IAM enforcement.     |
| Compliance Gaps                | Adopting frameworks like NIST CSF isn’t sufficient without operational enforcement and real-time controls.|
| SOC/NOC Detection Weakness     | Logs existed, but no automated detection or alerting occurred until public disclosure.                  |
| IAM Mismanagement              | The use of powerful credentials tied to non-isolated roles significantly increased attack impact.       |
| Trust and Financial Repercussions| 15% stock drop and class action lawsuits followed; reputational loss was immediate and substantial.     |
| Regulatory Inadequacy          | Existing laws and guidelines failed to anticipate SSRF and cloud-specific misconfigurations.             |

##### 4.3.5.4. Case Studies

[Red-teaming LLM Agents via Poisoning Memory or Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12784)

AGENTPOISON is the first red-teaming framework that targets RAG-based LLM agents by injecting malicious demonstrations into their long-term memory or knowledge base. It uses a novel constrained optimization to generate stealthy backdoor triggers that, when present in user instructions, retrieve adversarial memory records from the RAG retriever, guiding agents to generate malicious actions. Notably, AGENTPOISON does not require model fine-tuning and achieves high success rates (ASR ≥ 80%) across multiple domains (driving, QA, healthcare) while preserving performance on benign queries (≤1% drop in accuracy). It is resilient, transferable across retrievers, and evades existing defenses, posing a severe threat to LLM agent safety.

| **Aspect**     | **Summary**      |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Backdoor trigger poisons memory/RAG via stealthy prompts | Only a few optimized trigger tokens needed to consistently retrieve malicious demonstrations.           |
| No model fine-tuning required                       | AGENTPOISON performs purely via input manipulation, making it fast, cheap, and broadly applicable.      |
| High attack success rate across tasks               | Achieves ≥82% retrieval success and ≥63% end-to-end attack success on three real-world agents.           |
| Transferability across retrievers                  | Triggers optimized for one embedder work effectively on others (e.g., OpenAI-ADA, DPR, ORQA, REALM).    |
| Resilient to query perturbations                    | Maintains success even after word/letter injection or rephrasing of the trigger.                         |
| Stealthy trigger avoids detection                  | Trigger is coherent and semantically plausible, evading perplexity filters and rephrasing defenses.      |

***Real World Cases***

| **Domain**  | **Scenario**    | **Outcome**   |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|
| Autonomous Driving | Malicious trigger causes agent to retrieve STOP instructions, leading to unsafe braking.       | Deviation in trajectory and potential collision.                                                    |
| Healthcare Records | Trigger causes agent to issue DELETE command on patient data.                                   | Unsafe deletion of electronic health record (EHR) information.                                      |
| Knowledge QA       | Poisoned retrieval results in wrong or misleading answers to user queries.                     | User receives incorrect or unhelpful responses in education or research scenarios.                  |

|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LLM Agent Safety                 | Memory poisoning leads to unsafe actions (e.g., driving errors, wrong diagnoses, QA misinformation).    |
| Undetectable by traditional filters | Coherent and semantically valid triggers evade standard defenses like perplexity scoring or rephrasing. |
| Long-term persistence            | Poisoned records persist in memory or RAG knowledge base, making attacks durable and hard to clean.     |
| Cross-agent vulnerability        | The attack generalizes across agents and domains, indicating a systemic vulnerability in agent design.   |
| Compliance and audit failure     | Agents may silently violate safety/compliance without visibility to users or regulators.                |

#### 7.2.1. NIST SP 800-61r2 Computer Security Incident Handling Guide

***Reference:*** [NIST SP 800-61r3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf)

The NIST SP 800-61 Revision 3 (2025) modernizes incident response by embedding it within the broader context of cybersecurity risk management through alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. Unlike its predecessor, which focused on procedural guidance, this version adopts a flexible, outcome-driven approach using the six CSF Functions—Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—to guide organizations in managing, mitigating, and learning from cybersecurity incidents. The framework emphasizes continuous improvement, cross-functional coordination, and real-time learning across incident stages, integrating threat intelligence, asset visibility, and policy enforcement into an adaptive lifecycle. For AI systems and GenAI applications, the framework is especially applicable as it supports incident response for AI-specific threats such as prompt injection, model inversion, hallucinations, data leakage, adversarial misuse of toolchains (e.g., LangChain agents), and retrieval augmentation abuse. It enables organizations to adapt incident handling playbooks, define AI-relevant response roles, log and monitor AI inputs/outputs, and apply continuous learning to secure model behavior and data exposure. Through its flexible and modular structure, SP 800-61r3 provides a resilient foundation for defending dynamic, intelligent, and increasingly autonomous AI ecosystems.

<br>

##### 7.2.1.1. Key Concept

SP 800-61r3 shifts from static procedural guidance to a flexible, CSF 2.0-aligned risk management profile, suitable for dynamic, evolving technologies like AI systems.

It replaces the old linear IR lifecycle with a model mapped to the six CSF 2.0 Functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover — all of which are critical for GenAI environments where risks emerge through prompt injection, model behavior, data flow, and tool orchestration.

| CSF Function | AI-Specific Considerations |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **Govern (GV)** | Establish AI-specific IR policies: include prompt injection, misuse of RAG pipelines, and training data exposures. Ensure third-party responsibilities (e.g., model vendors or SaaS orchestration) are contractually defined. |
| **Identify (ID)** | Inventory LLM tools, APIs, model endpoints, and external connectors. Capture attack surfaces such as embeddings, memory modules, toolchains (LangChain, ReAct). Threat modeling must include jailbreaking and adversarial prompts. |
| **Protect (PR)** | Implement robust input/output guardrails, system prompts, and behavioral constraints. Ensure LLM telemetry, prompt logs, and PII filters are enabled. Validate training pipelines to prevent data poisoning or unintentional PII ingestion. |
| **Detect (DE)** | Continuously monitor prompt patterns, output anomalies, and system behavior. Correlate logs from LLM APIs, tool executions, and chat sessions. Integrate LLM-as-a-Judge metrics and fine-tuned filters to detect AI-targeted abuse. |
| **Respond (RS)** | Coordinate across AI/ML teams, SREs, legal, and security to investigate and contain AI-specific incidents like data leakage or unauthorized tool invocation. Update response plans to reflect LLM threats and recovery protocols. |
| **Recover (RC)** | Restore compromised AI services, rollback fine-tuned models or agent states, redact unsafe memory or embeddings. Update RAG sources and retrain if training data was involved in the breach. Conduct post-mortems with AI-specific lens. |

<br>

##### 7.2.1.2. Key Recommendations

| ***NIST Recommendation***                     | ***AI System Implication***                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Establish IR policy & procedures**    | Include AI-specific incident types and response playbooks for AI misuse, such as unauthorized API use, hallucinations, or data leakage. |
| **Communication protocols**             | Define rules for disclosure and response involving model vendors (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), data controllers, and regulators (for privacy breaches). |
| **Team structure**                      | Ensure inclusion of AI/ML engineers, data scientists, legal advisors, and system architects alongside traditional CSIRTs. |
| **Shared Responsibility**       | Contracts must clearly define incident roles/responsibilities across cloud services, model providers, and orchestration tools. |
| **Telemetry & Forensics**      | Log prompt/response pairs, tool execution traces, embeddings, and system prompts for investigation. |
| **Automated detection**                 | Leverage metrics from LLM guardrails, behavioral scoring, and RAG pipeline telemetry to detect attacks (e.g., prompt-based exfiltration). |
| **Incident Response Playbooks** | Define specific playbooks for GenAI issues: misuse of agents, hallucination of critical data, unauthorized RAG retrieval. |
| **Information sharing**                 | Coordinate with external AI incident hubs (like responsible AI research communities or regulatory bodies) for emerging attack techniques. |
| **Continuous Improvement (ID.IM)** | Post-incident lessons should inform prompt engineering updates, model fine-tuning policies, and toolchain governance. |
