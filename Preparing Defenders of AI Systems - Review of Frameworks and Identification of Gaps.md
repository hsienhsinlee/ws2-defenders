# Preparing Defenders of AI Systems:  Review of Frameworks and Identification of Gaps

## OASIS Open Project : [Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)](https://github.com/cosai-oasis) - [Workstream 2: Preparing Defenders for a Changing Cybersecurity Landscape](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/ws2-defenders)

## 1. Preparing Defenders of AI Systems

### 1.1. Executive Summary

Organizations of all sizes are rapidly integrating artificial intelligence into their operations. Securing AI systems and applications has emerged as a critical cybersecurity challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing frameworks—including NIST CSF 2.0, NIST RMF, various iterations of the NIST AI RMF, MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE ATLAS, and MITRE CAPEC, OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications, OWASP GenAI Red Team Guide, and OWASP Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations. This paper evaluates their applicability in defending AI-specific assets. By mapping these frameworks to organizational roles and responsibilities, the paper highlights the strengths and limitations of current approaches in addressing the unique risks posed by AI technologies.

Key gaps identified across the reviewed frameworks include the lack of AI-specific threat intelligence, inadequate controls for adversarial attacks, and insufficient integration of AI risks within traditional cybersecurity practices. These include areas such as adversarial AI/ML, supply chain vulnerabilities, and incident response tailored to AI systems require targeted enhancements. To address these deficiencies, the paper outlines actionable recommendations—ranging from integrating AI-tailored threat models and expanding Zero Trust principles to securing the AI supply chain and establishing dedicated AI incident response playbooks.

### 1.2. Changing Attack Surface with AI Adoption

#### 1.2.1. AI Risk examples

AI systems are fundamentally altering the cybersecurity landscape by expanding attack surfaces and introducing new risks. Their reliance on extensive computational resources, novel data formats, and vast data processing capabilities, combined with their inherently non-deterministic nature, makes them both a prime target and an enabler of sophisticated cyber threats. AI systems can be primary targets or enabler of the attacks on other assets, targets, infrastructures and business processes. 

##### 1.2.1.1 AI as a Target: Key Security Risks

AI systems can be directly targeted through various attack vectors, including:
+ Prompt Injection Attacks. Attackers manipulate AI models by injecting indirect or direct prompts that push the system beyond its intended operational boundaries. This can lead to outputs that are misleading, harmful, biased, or in violation of compliance regulations.
+ Supply Chain Attacks on AI Models. AI models and datasets, particularly pre-trained versions sourced from third parties, may contain hidden backdoors, biases, or embedded malicious triggers that can be exploited post-deployment.
+ Data Extraction and Privacy Risks. AI systems process sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII), proprietary intellectual property, and authentication tokens. Adversaries can extract this information from AI models during training or inference stages.
+ AI Infrastructure Exploitation
  + Code Execution Vulnerabilities: Attackers may manipulate AI systems to execute arbitrary code, leveraging AI computing resources for malicious purposes.
  + Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: AI systems can be overwhelmed through various DoS techniques, disrupting availability.
  + Protocol Abuse: AI relies on distributed data processing, making it susceptible to adversarial-in-the-middle attacks and data injection threats targeting its communication protocols.

##### 1.2.1.2 AI as an Enabler of Cyber Attacks on other assets, targets, infrastructures

AI Systems can be leveraged to enhance precision, scalability, and automation in executing sophisticated attacks.
+ Augmenting Existing Attack Strategies
  + Multilingual and Context-Aware Threats: AI allows attackers to craft highly localized phishing campaigns in multiple languages, bypassing traditional detection mechanisms.
  + Adaptive Attacks: AI enhances reconnaissance capabilities, enabling tailored attack strategies against specific targets.
  + Automation of Attack Chains: AI streamlines adversarial workflows, including automation of credential theft, reconnaissance, and social engineering.
+ AI-Driven Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks. Attackers can exploit AI systems to initiate and orchestrate large-scale, adaptive DoS attacks against third-party infrastructure.
+ Emerging AI-Enabled Cyber Risks
  + Synthetic Identities & Deepfake-Based risks: AI-generated synthetic identities and deepfake technologies can bypass identity verification, authentication, and fraud detection systems.
  + Circumventing Zero Trust Security Models: AI-generated traffic patterns and behaviors can mimic behavior of legitimate systems and users, diminishing the efficacy of Zero Trust security models.
  + Social Engineering and Misinformation: AI-driven generation of fake text, audio, and video content enables large-scale manipulation of public opinion, reputational damage, and extortion schemes.

##### 1.2.1.3 AI Risks in Business Processes

AI integration into business operations introduces additional risk that organizations must address.
+ Overreliance on AI in Critical Processes. Excessive dependence on AI-driven automation in mission-critical functions can result in severe operational disruptions if the system fails or is compromised.
+ Reputational and Compliance Risks. Organizations deploying AI for customer interactions, regulatory compliance, or decision-making must consider non-deterministic nature of AI and additional risks of AI interacting on behalf of the organisation or business entity.
+ AI's Non-Deterministic Nature. AI's probabilistic decision-making processes can introduce significant variations in outcomes. For instance, minor data variations in AI-driven quality control in the pharmaceutical sector can impact product safety and efficacy of the final product.
+ Legal and Non-Repudiation Challenges. AI-driven decision-making raises accountability concerns, particularly in cases where AI autonomously makes business-critical or legally binding decisions.

#### 1.2.2. AI Defender Frameworks Overview

The rapidly evolving landscape of AI systems demands a comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, which is why understanding and implementing various defender frameworks in concert is crucial. These frameworks have emerged from different sectors - including government, industry, and academia - each bringing unique perspectives and strengths to AI security. The diversity of frameworks reflects the complex nature of AI systems and the varied threats they face, from data poisoning and model extraction to adversarial attacks and privacy breaches.

Defender frameworks typically operate on multiple levels, addressing technical, operational, and governance aspects of AI security. At the technical level, frameworks provide guidance for secure model development, testing procedures, and deployment practices. Operationally, they establish protocols for monitoring, incident response, and continuous improvement. From a governance perspective, these frameworks help organizations align AI security with broader risk management strategies and compliance requirements.

Modern AI security frameworks encompass various approaches to protecting AI systems. Some focus on risk management and mitigation strategies throughout the AI system lifecycle, while others emphasize regulatory compliance and security requirements specific to certain regions or industries. Additionally, frameworks developed from industry experience offer practical insights and methodologies developed through real-world implementation of AI systems at scale.

Together, these frameworks create a foundation for addressing the complex challenges of securing AI systems. While each framework has its own focus and strengths, they collectively provide comprehensive guidance for protecting AI models, securing sensitive data, and ensuring responsible AI deployment. Their complementary nature reflects the understanding that AI security requires multiple perspectives and approaches to address the full spectrum of potential threats and vulnerabilities.

#### 1.2.3. Change needed for Defenders of AI Systems

MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, NIST AI AML provide defenders of AI systems with the most AI-specific guidance.  MITRE ATLAS covers adversarial tactics and techniques in detail, specifying attacker general goals against AI systems and the steps in the attack.  NIST CSF, NIST RMF, MITRE CAPEC and CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model provide more general security guidance, but could be expanded to better incorporate AI-specific risks, both for adversarial attacks and for vulnerabilities related to data, models or guardrails for AI systems.  The MIT Risk Repository offers insights for governance stakeholders, but doesn't provide enough low-level detail to inform defenders of AI systems about security measures.  Current defender frameworks require extensions to properly deal with securing AI systems, some themes of which are repeated across frameworks.

| **Gap**               | **What is missing**   |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Threat model for AI** | Specific adversarial techniques including the mechanisms that exploit weaknesses particular to AI systems |
| **Incident Response or Mitigations** | Fine-grain detail on actions for playbooks for incident response, mitigation and prevention |
| **Integration with other Cybersecurity Frameworks** | Map framework details to other frameworks for interoperability |
| **AI Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** | Weaknesses in supply chain regarding data, code and models that create AI system vulnerabilities |
| **Model Behavior Analysis** | Determining nominal behavior, monitoring and analysis of any behavior drift in models to ensure their proper function |

In a new world dominated by AI powered ecosystems defenders of AI systems (CISOs, security architects, SOC teams, threat hunters, and AI governance experts) must adapt new strategies, frameworks, and methodologies to address evolving AI security threats.

#### 1.3.5. Leveraging Defender Frameworks

This work reviews the body of knowledge preparing defenders of AI systems, including many of the framework standards used for cybersecurity.  It makes three contributions to guide securing AI systems:
1. Overview and detail on defender frameworks
2. Mapping frameworks to organizational roles and responsibilities
3. Identifying the gaps in these frameworks

For each framework from the defenders corpus we provide an overview identifying the source, purpose and audience of the material.  An overview of the material and its scope for general or specific cybersecurity topics including defense of AI systems is presented.  Further detail on the framework is provided, especially for practioners, summarized to capture the key concepts in and uses for the framework.  This material is intended to give defenders a systematic guide to understand how each framework is applicable to their work.

Organizational roles are categorized, and each framework is mapped to intended audiences and stakeholders.  This document presents a high-level mapping, and the framework detail mapping breaks down responsibilities further.  For each, a RACI matrix is used to map roles to the actions specified for the framework, indicating who is responsible, accountable, consulted and informed.  This mapping assists defenders in understanding the responsibilities associated for each framework, which roles are responsible and how.

Gaps in each framework are identified, and gaps common to all frameworks are surfaced in this document.  This points to extensions required to the system of frameworks in order to effectively secure AI systems.  Specific missing elements for each framework are also identified, indicating specific work that may be done to cover these gaps.

###### 2.1.1.1.3. Guidance provided

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance for organizations to manage cybersecurity risks effectively and integrate cybersecurity practices with broader enterprise risk management strategies. 

The NIST CSF 2.0 serves as a foundational tool to:

1. Standardize cybersecurity practices across organizations, sectors, and regions.
2. Integrate cybersecurity into business strategies and risk management frameworks.
3. Adapt to emerging challenges in technology, supply chains, and global threats.
4. Foster a culture of proactive risk management and continuous improvement.

<br><br>

##### 2.1.1.2. Detail on current framework

CSF consists of three core sections:

1. ***CSF Core:*** A hierarchy of cybersecurity outcomes categorized into six Functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
2. ***Profiles:*** Mechanisms to describe an organization's current and target cybersecurity postures.
3. ***Tiers:*** Four levels (Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive) for evaluating the rigor of cybersecurity governance and risk management.

##### 2.1.1.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

The NIST CSF 2.0 provides a strong general framework but could be enhanced for AI system defenders by:

1. Incorporating AI-specific risks, such as adversarial attacks, model drift, and poisoning.
2. Addressing supply chain vulnerabilities unique to AI.
3. Providing detailed guidance for AI-focused incident response, recovery, and monitoring.
4. Integrating AI ethics, explainability, and transparency into governance practices.
5. Explicitly aligning with NIST AI RMF for a holistic approach to AI risk management.

<br><br>

#### 2.1.2. NIST RMF

##### 2.1.2.1. Overview
 
The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a structured framework, that integrates security and privacy into the lifecycle of information systems (including AI systems). It is widely used in federal agencies and private organizations to ensure a consistent, scalable, and effective method for protecting sensitive information.

The RMF is mandatory for federal agencies under laws like FISMA (Federal Information Security Modernization Act) and is recommended for private organizations seeking robust risk management practices. It aligns closely with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for broader risk management.

<br><br>

###### 2.1.2.1.1. Scoping of AI system and/or cybersecurity purview

In the NIST RMF, scoping is critical to the Prepare, Categorize, and Select steps. It ensures that the boundaries of the system, its operational context, and applicable controls are well-defined to align with organizational objectives, compliance requirements, and risk management strategies.

| **RMF Step**       | **Scoping Objective**                                                                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prepare**         | Define the scope of the system, including boundaries, stakeholders, critical assets, and risk management strategies. |
| **Categorize**      | Identify the scope of information and systems to be categorized based on their confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact. |
| **Select**          | Determine the scope of security and privacy controls required to address identified risks and tailor them to system needs. |
| **Implement**       | Apply controls to all scoped system components and document how they address the defined security and privacy boundaries. |
| **Assess**          | Validate that scoped controls operate effectively within the defined boundaries and meet security/privacy objectives. |
| **Authorize**       | Ensure the scoped system and its components are evaluated for residual risks within the defined authorization boundary. |
| **Monitor**         | Continuously monitor scoped assets and controls to detect changes, emerging threats, and ensure compliance with security objectives. |

##### 2.1.5.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

From a defender's perspective, the NIST AI 100-2e2023 Framework provides a solid foundation for understanding adversarial risks but requires enhancements to address practical challenges. Key missing elements include detailed playbooks, incident response protocols, and tools for testing AI robustness. Defenders need more guidance on lightweight, scalable defenses, threat intelligence sharing, and securing the AI supply chain.

### 2.2. MITRE

#### 2.2.1. MITRE ATT&CK

##### 2.2.1.1. Overview

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a globally recognized, open-source knowledge base that documents real-world adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across the cyber-attack lifecycle. It organizes adversary behaviors into tactics (the high level goals attackers intend to achieve), techniques/sub-techniques (the specific methods to accomplish those goals), and procedures (the detailed steps an adversary would take to implement the technique). The TTPs are mapped into an intuitive matrix that spans multiple domains, including enterprise, mobile, cloud, and industrial control systems (ICS). Originally focused on post-attack activities, it now also includes early-stage attacker actions like reconnaissance. 

ATT&CK serves as a practical tool for red teaming, behavioral analytics, threat intelligence enrichment, and defensive gap assessments, linking techniques to adversary groups, software, and mitigations. It provides a practical, data-driven guide to strengthening defenses against real-world threats. Of note, entries in ATT&CK are drawn from publicly reported incidents or offensive research, so that the model is grounded in real-world threats and not theoretical techniques with limited utility. 


###### 2.2.1.1.1. Scoping of AI system and/or cybersecurity purview

The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a structured approach for identifying, analyzing, and addressing threats in AI systems and cybersecurity.

ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) provides comprehensive guidance for defending AI systems by addressing unique threats such as data poisoning, adversarial inputs, model theft, API exploitation, and AI misuse. It extends the MITRE ATT&CK framework with AI-specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), emphasizing the need to secure AI across its lifecycle—from data preparation and model training to inference and operation. 

ATLAS advocates for robust detection and mitigation strategies, including behavioral analytics, adversarial robustness testing, and strict access controls, while integrating AI into red and blue team exercises and enhancing threat intelligence. It also highlights the importance of securing AI supply chains, protecting pre-trained models and frameworks, and addressing cross-domain risks in cloud, edge, and IoT environments. 


##### 2.2.2.2. Detail on current framework

The design and structure of MITRE ATLAS reflect its commitment to providing a comprehensive, adaptable framework for addressing adversarial threats to AI systems. Its integration of tactics, techniques, and real-world procedures, combined with a focus on tools and mitigations, ensures its utility across diverse AI environments. By targeting the unique vulnerabilities of AI systems, ATLAS serves as both a practical resource and a strategic guide for securing the next generation of intelligent technologies.

###### 2.2.2.2.1. ATLAS Matrix

The ATLAS Matrix provides a visual representation of adversary tactics and techniques, similar to the ATT&CK Matrix but adapted for AI systems. It organizes:

1. Tactics as the top-level categories (e.g., Data Poisoning, Evasion, Extraction).
2. Techniques under each tactic as actionable adversary behaviors.
3. Links to Procedures that document real-world use cases and observed attacks.


###### 2.2.2.2.2. Core Components

The ATLAS Framework is organized into components that reflect the adversarial threat landscape of AI systems. These components include Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and are designed to capture adversary behavior in both training and inference stages.

***Tactics***

Tactics represent adversary goals and are categorized to address the unique operational aspects of AI systems. Each tactic defines a specific objective the adversary seeks to achieve. AI-Specific Tactics include:

| **Tactic**              | **Description**                                                                                  |

##### 2.2.2.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

MITRE ATLAS is a strong framework for understanding adversarial tactics and techniques targeting AI systems, but it needs to evolve to cover specific adversarial techniques, AI supply chain risks, and model behavior. Furthermore, defenders of AI systems would benefit from better integration with broader cybersecurity frameworks. Addressing these gaps would enhance ATLAS's ability to support defenders in securing AI systems against increasingly sophisticated and novel threats.

While ATLAS provides detail on adversarial tactics and techniques, its stated goal is a knowledge base, and does not help defenders prioritize mitigations and countermeasures. Its target audience of developers, incident responders, and security analysts means that it is not easily understood by executives and risk compliance, as it focuses on individual tactics rather than helping make decisions based on a higher level risk management framework.


#### 2.2.3. MITRE CAPEC

##### 2.2.3.1. Overview

The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) is a standardized, community-driven framework for understanding, categorizing, and mitigating cyber-attack techniques. It provides a structured taxonomy of attack patterns that describe methods attackers use to exploit software systems. While CAPEC is not designed to defend AI systems it is relevant for AI-based systems focused on cybersecurity, as it provides machine-readable, systematic descriptions of attacks that can be used to enhance threat detection, prevention, and response capabilities.


###### 2.2.3.1.1. Scoping of AI system and/or cybersecurity purview

CAPEC is not designed to scope cybersecurity of AI system. However it can be very valuable framework to aid building AI based cybersecurity systems.

| **Focus Area**                      | **CAPEC Integration**                                                                                  | **AI Application Examples**                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proactive Threat Modeling**       | CAPEC supports identifying, simulating, and mitigating attack scenarios during the design phase.      | AI analyzes system design to predict attacks like Phishing (CAPEC-98) and recommend mitigations.        |
| **Dynamic Threat Modeling**         | CAPEC enables real-time threat modeling and attack chain prediction using AI systems.                 | AI dynamically models attack chains (e.g., from Credential Theft to Privilege Escalation).          |
| **SIEM Integration**                | CAPEC patterns help AI-enhanced SIEM tools detect malicious activity by correlating logs with attacks.| AI flags network traffic anomalies based on CAPEC-defined patterns like HTTP Response Splitting (CAPEC-34). |
| **SOAR Platforms**                  | AI-driven SOAR systems automate threat response workflows based on CAPEC attack metadata.             | AI automates response playbooks for attacks such as SQL Injection (CAPEC-66) based on CAPEC severity.   |
| **Endpoint Detection and Response** | CAPEC attack descriptions guide AI-based endpoint analysis to detect malicious activity.              | AI identifies and mitigates Malware Execution (CAPEC-175) on endpoints.                                 |
| **Threat Intelligence Enrichment**  | CAPEC integrates with threat intelligence frameworks like STIX/TAXII to enrich data with attack info. | AI correlates live threat feeds with CAPEC patterns to detect emerging threats.                             |
| **Threat Actor Profiling**          | CAPEC patterns assist AI systems in analyzing TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) of adversaries.  | AI identifies adversarial tactics through attack patterns like Credential Abuse or Malware Injection.|
| **Predictive Threat Analysis**      | CAPEC attack lifecycle context allows AI to predict emerging threats and preemptively respond.        | AI predicts new attacks based on historical CAPEC data and prioritizes preemptive mitigations.              |

##### 2.2.4.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

D3FEND is primarily designed for mapping defensive cybersecurity techniques to known adversarial TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK, focusing on traditional cybersecurity defenses rather than AI security. At this point D3FEND does not yet integrate AI-specific threat mappings covered by MITRE ATLAS. There are no current D3FEND techniques explicitly addressing adversarial ML, model robustness, AI compliance, or LLM security, indicating gaps in AI security defense strategies.

| What is Missing?                           | Details |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Comprehensive Adversarial ML Defense      | D3FEND does not currently provide structured defensive techniques for mitigating adversarial ML attacks, including perturbation-based evasion and data poisoning. |
| AI-Specific Threat Intelligence Mapping   | D3FEND lacks mappings to AI-related attack techniques from MITRE ATLAS or AI-specific threat intelligence sources, limiting AI defenders' ability to track adversarial tactics. |
| LLM Security & Prompt Injection Protection | D3FEND does not cover security mechanisms for mitigating prompt injection attacks, adversarial instruction manipulation, or harmful AI-generated outputs in large language models (LLMs). |
| AI Supply Chain Security                  | D3FEND does not define security techniques for verifying AI model provenance, cryptographic signing of AI models, or securing the AI model supply chain. |
| Real-Time AI Model Telemetry & Monitoring | The framework does not provide techniques for continuously monitoring AI model behavior, detecting adversarial drift, or preventing inference manipulation. |
| Model Robustness & Integrity Verification | There are no defined defensive techniques in D3FEND for verifying AI model robustness against adversarial ML attacks, including model evasion and inversion attacks. |
| Secure AI Model Access & API Protections  | D3FEND does not outline access control mechanisms specific to AI models, including protections against API abuse, unauthorized access, and model inversion attacks. |

### 2.3. CISA

#### 2.3.1. Zero Trust Maturity Model 2.0

##### 2.3.1.1. Overview

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published the second version of the Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM) in Apr 2023.  "This ZTMM is one of many paths that an organization can take in designing and implementing their transition plan to zero trust architectures in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 14028 'Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity,' which requires that agencies develop a plan to implement a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA).".  CISA provides a roadmap for incremental adoption of ZTA, clarifying requirements to advance maturity in Zero Trust adoption and thereby improve security.

###### 2.3.1.1.1. Cybersecurity Purview

The Zero Trust Maturity Model provides guidance on how to enforce accurate, least privilege access decisions across information systems by assuming that any part of the system may be viewed as compromised. It provides requirements for system governance, access and use that rely on a principle of "don't trust; verify."  This notion of not trusting identities, data, network communications, workloads and even hardware until they are authenticated provides a comprehensive trusted system.  The ZTMM provides a set of levels describing the maturity of an organization's ZTA adoption, from Traditional security (no ZTA), to Initial, Advanced and Optimal ZTA maturity.  With clear best practices and a tiered system encouraging self-evaluation and improvement, the ZTMM provides a system that can characterize and systematically assist improving the security effectiveness of defenders.

###### 2.3.1.1.2. Persona Addressed

Zero Trust Architecture is a requirement for US Federal agencies.  CISA directly addresses the security stakeholders of these agencies.  Organizations implementing a Zero Trust Architecture will have similar roles and responsibilities.  The division of responsibilities may vary from organization to organization, but they will generally require executives accountable for driving implementation, architects informing proper implementation, and operators responsible for many implementation details.

###### 2.3.1.1.3. Guidance Provided

The Zero Trust Maturity model informs security stakeholders about their level of Zero Trust Architecture adoption.  It promotes the principle of least privileged access across the domains of data, identity, network, devices and application workloads.  The Zero Trust Maturity model identifies 4 levels of adoption for each of these domains, or pillars.  Traditional maturity implies Zero Trust has not yet been adopted for that domain.  Initial, Advanced and Optimal maturity reflect subsequent levels of ZTA adoption, according to specific features for that domain.  There are also 3 cross-cutting features, apply to all of these pillars individually and across pillar boundaries.  These include Governance as a foundation, Automation and Orchestration above this, and Visibility and Analytics resting on top of these.  This Zero Trust Maturity Model framework provides a roadmap for stakeholders to implement Zero Trust Architecture.

##### 2.3.1.2. Detail on current framework

###### 2.3.1.2.1. Zero Trust Principles

***NIST SP 800-207 defines the tenets of Zero Trust:***
1. All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
2. All communication is secured regardless of network location.
3. Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
4. Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy—including the observable state of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset—and may include other behavioral and environmental attributes.
5. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets.
6. All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
7. The enterprise works with the Organizations to catalog and inventory existing Cyber Security policies and standards. Policies are updated and created in cross pillar activities as needed to meet critical ZT Target functionality.

Throughout, the principle that no asset nor identity has any inherent trust is reiterated; defenders should assume there is a current breach and take extra steps to establish trust. This applies to all assets and identities within an organization.  The context of an identity's access to a resource should be rich enough to conclude that authorization is warranted, e.g. using multi-factor authentication combined with network and device attestation signals.  These tenets guide the best practices for the different pillars the ZTA uses to specify architectural components.


###### 2.3.1.2.2. Zero Trust Pillars

The Zero Trust Architecture defines enterprise architectures as comprised of 5 pillars: Data, Identity, Devices, Network Communications, and Application Workloads.
+ Data includes all digital artifacts from files, metadata and fragments to databases to all data in transit, archived, or used at some point
+ Identity refers to the attributes that uniquely define a human or non-human user
+ Devices include all the organizations compute assets, including servers, laptops, network edge devices, printers, and IoT devices
+ Network refers to all communication media, including internal networks, wireless, the global Internet, and other channels for communicating digital information
+ Application Workloads includes programs and services running on organization assets - on-premise, on mobile or in the cloud

The ZTMM maps security implementations for each of the pillars to 4 levels of maturity, based on specific security features required for that pillar to adhere to the Zero Trust principles. The granularity of recommendations enable stakeholders to assess their Zero Trust maturity across these domains and provide steps to Optimal ZTA maturity.  For each pillar, these are the pillar specific features:
+ Data:  Data Inventory Management, Data Categorization, Data Availability, Data Access, and Data Encryption
+ Identity: Authentication, Identity Storage, Risk Assessment, Access Management
+ Devices: Policy and Compliance, Supply Chain Risk Management, Resource Access, Device Threat Protection
+ Network: Segmentation, Traffic Management, Traffic Encryption, Network Resilience
+ Application Workload: Application Access, Application Threat Protection, Application Accessibility, Secure Development Lifecycle, Application Security Testing

###### 2.3.1.2.3. Zero Trust Cross-Cutting Features

The ZTMM identifies 3 features that cut across the pillars:  Governance, Automation and Orchestration, and Visibility and Analytics.  Governance serves as the foundation of the Zero Trust pillars.  Organizations must govern their assets and identities, fully aware of all data,, network communication, and application workloads.  Compliance with external and internal policy enforces governance.  This requires Automation and Orchestration of tooling required for the pillar or pillars, enabling comprehensive processes for governance.  Visibility and Analytics, whether from simple measurements and detection rules or complicated behavioral analytics, provide the mechanisms for ensuring that each pillar complies with governance.

"These three cross-cutting capabilities highlight activities to support interoperability of functions across pillars based on the following descriptions: 
+ Visibility and Analytics: Visibility refers to the observable artifacts that result from the characteristics of and events within enterprise-wide environments. The focus on cyber-related data analysis can help inform policy decisions, facilitate response activities, and build a risk profile to develop proactive security measures before an incident occurs.  
+ Automation and Orchestration: Zero trust makes full use of automated tools and workflows that support security response functions across products and services while maintaining oversight, security, and interaction of the development process for such functions, products, and services.  
+ Governance: Governance refers to the definition and associated enforcement of agency cybersecurity policies, procedures, and processes, within and across pillars, to manage an agency's enterprise and mitigate security risks in support of zero trust principles and fulfillment of federal requirements."

##### 2.3.1.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

The Zero Trust Maturity Model explicitly excludes recommendations on best practices for incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities with Zero Trust. However, the fundamental concepts introduced by Zero Trust---least privilege, assumption of breach, and continuous authentication and authorization---are relevant for developers of AI systems that have access to sensitive data sets.

***AI Data Access Patterns***
The Zero Trust Maturity Model does not address typical deployments of AI systems, including Retrieval Augmented Generation.  AI is data driven, and vector databases are built for speed and not with Zero Trust access and encryption standards in mind.  The data access patterns for AI systems must implement the controls for proper Zero Trust Architecture, and this guidance is missing.

***AI Training Data Provenance***
If the training data for models is unknown, and the models can reproduce this data, then it is considered ungoverned data in the Zero Trust Architecture. This means that data used to train models must be known and available in order to ensure it complies with policy.  Building trust in that data requires some authentication of it, to verify that it is reputable data.

***AI Authorization Patterns***
Observing the principle of least-privileged access is often ignored in AI adoption, in order to facilitate AI access to data or tools.  The identity of AI application workloads should respect this principle by minimizing access to the least privilege among the AI user and the AI system privileges itself.  User access should not trampoline through AI system use, nor should AI systems provide more authority to users than they are otherwise allowed.

***AI Agency***
The Zero Trust Maturity Model emphasizes that no asset has inherent trust, and therefore, any access to resources must be gated through an authorization mechanism to re-validate the asset's ability to access that resource. While this approach can, and should, be applied to AI systems, there is no explicit mention of constraining the agency of AI systems to make authorization decisions in the ZTMM. The ZTMM does not call out the 

***AI Model Visibility and Analytics***
The behavior of AI systems must be established through monitoring its use.  Since these are stochastic systems, they are prone to produce unpredictable results (hallucinations).  Behavior can change as model versions are updated, and even as prompt templates are modified.  Establishing baseline behavior for AI models is required to understand when they are producing anomalous results.

***AI Driven Conclusions***
Governance for AI driven conclusions is required to ensure that automations comply with internal and external policies.  Determining what conclusions require humans-in-the-loop and what automations are resource limited will mitigate many risks.  Increasing the transparency and explainability of AI systems and requiring them in some use cases will also reduce opaque decision making.

***AI Resilience from Adversarial Attacks***
Vulnerability management for AI systems is a new and changing domain.  Novel attacks against AI systems continue, and the resilience of these systems needs to be increased.  ZTA adoption requires better characterization of AI system attack surface and weaknesses, so that proper defenses may be deployed.

##### 2.4.1.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

While STIX 2.1 is a powerful framework for sharing and representing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), there are several gaps when it comes to AI system-specific threats, including adversarial attacks, model integrity, and real-time learning. Defenders of AI systems need additional tools, object types, and relationships within the STIX framework to represent and address the unique threats posed to AI, especially as these systems become more integral to cybersecurity efforts.

The inclusion of AI-specific elements within STIX 2.1 would provide a more comprehensive approach to protecting AI models and infrastructure from cyberattacks, ensuring that AI-driven cybersecurity solutions can be as secure as possible.

***Key Missing Elements***

1. **Threat Representation for AI:** While STIX 2.1 represents traditional cyber threats well, there are no dedicated constructs for AI-specific threats (e.g., adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model evasion).
2. **AI Model Integrity and Trust:** The architecture doesn't include ways to monitor or assess AI model integrity, making it difficult to track AI-specific weaknesses.
3. **Adversarial Attacks and AI-specific Threat Chains:** Missing definitions for adversarial AI attacks (e.g., adversarial inputs, model inversion) within the STIX model makes it hard to track threats to AI systems.
4. **Dynamic Learning and Real-Time Threat Integration:** AI models evolve over time, and STIX 2.1 does not currently address continuous model updates, leaving defenders without an integrated solution for real-time learning adjustments.
5. **Storage of AI-specific Data in STIX 2.1:** There is a lack of focus on storing, querying, and sharing data about AI models and their associated data streams or continuous learning processes in a way that makes it actionable for defenders.


<br><br>

***Other Challenges and Considerations***

| **Challenge**   | **Description**          | **Impact on AI Systems**   | **Impact on Cybersecurity Operations**   |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **High Volume Data Streams**                | Managing and processing large amounts of STIX data in real-time or near-real-time scenarios.                  | Performance bottlenecks when ingesting or processing high volumes of STIX data.     | Difficult to maintain real-time detection and response at scale.                   |
|                                             |                                                                                                             | Latency in processing large volumes impacts AI decision-making speed.               | Slower response times and delayed threat detection due to high data volume.        |
| **Accuracy and Relevance of Detection**     | Ensuring that AI models correctly detect and prioritize relevant threats from large datasets.                | High false positive/negative rates if the model is trained on irrelevant data.      | Difficulty in distinguishing relevant from non-relevant threats, impacting response.|
|                                             |                                                                                                             | Misclassification of data could lead to inaccurate automated responses.             | Increased workload for human analysts due to irrelevant alerts.                    |
| **Storage and Querying Efficiency (SQL)**   | Storing and querying graph-based STIX data efficiently in relational databases.                              | SQL databases may struggle with handling highly interconnected data like STIX objects. | Performance degradation when querying for complex relationships in large datasets. |
|                                             |                                                                                                             | Complex joins for relationships can significantly slow down performance.            | Difficulty scaling SQL systems to accommodate the volume and complexity of STIX data. |
| **Storage and Querying Efficiency (NoSQL)** | Handling STIX 2.1 graph data in NoSQL databases that are designed for unstructured data.                      | NoSQL databases may face challenges maintaining relationships in graph-based data.  | Complex querying over unstructured NoSQL data may result in slow responses.       |
|                                             |                                                                                                             | Lack of structured schema leads to difficulties in querying related STIX objects.    | Inconsistent or missing relationships make it difficult to analyze threat connections. |

### 2.5. MIT

#### 2.5.1. MIT AI Risk Repository

##### 2.5.1.1. Overview

MIT FutureTech along with the University of Queensland developed the AI Risk Repository to provide an accessible and extensible overview of threats from AI.  The Risk Repository includes a website with a growing repository of over 1000 risks taken from other publications, using the corpus of publications to inform taxonomies on AI Risk.  A high level causal taxonomy and a more detailed multi-level domain taxonomy are provided as tools for policy makers, risk evaluators, industry and academic AI users, developers, and defenders.  


###### 2.5.1.1.1. Scoping of AI system and/or cybersecurity purview

The AI Risk Repository addresses risks from the human-level capabilities of AI systems.  The domain taxonomy contains 7 main domains, of which the domain Privacy and Security contains the subdomain AI system security vulnerabilities and attacks.  Other risks MIT identifies including violations of privacy, misuse of AI to conduct fraud or cyberattacks, and misalignment of AI systems also inform defenders of AI systems of additional risks to these systems.  Risks of human overreliance on AI or human loss of agency are worth considering as a great of deal of security becomes automated with AI tools.


###### 2.5.1.1.2. Persona addressed

This work seeks to address all stakeholders of AI risk.  As such it aims for policymakers and regulators with a comprehensive treatment of risks, and comprehensible taxonomies.  It also serves academics and researchers well, synthesizing dozens of other AI risk frameworks and taxonomies, and providing both a starting and landing spot for additional work on AI risk.  Finally it informs industry of risks of AI systems, so that safer systems may be developed.  As such, it does not specifically address cyber defenders nor defenders of AI systems.


###### 2.5.1.1.3. Guidance provided

The causal and domain taxonomies provide common terminology to discuss AI risks.  Tying these risks to a body of knowledge detailing these risks as well as mapping to incidents manifesting the risk make the AI Risk Repository a map to additional detail on risk research.  Providing a database to record new risks and incorporate new frameworks keeps the risk map up to date.



##### 2.5.1.2. Detail on current framework

###### 2.5.1.2.1. Causal Taxonomy

The Causal Taxonomy provides three risk features, each with three values:
+ ***Entity:*** Human, Computer, Other
+ ***Intent:***  Unintentional, Intentional, Other
+ ***Timing:*** Pre-Deployment, Post-Deployment, Other

The simplicity of this enables quick assignment of the cause of a risk, pointing to preventative strategies for what, how and when a risk should be mitigated.  These features are easily explained to a wide audience, and serve as a durable risk taxonomy, with distinctions that will continue to provide value in understanding the causes of AI risk.


| **Category**       | **Level**         | **Description**                                      |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| AI                | Decision-based    | Due to a decision or action made by an AI system    |
| Human             | Decision-based    | Due to a decision or action made by humans         |
| Other             | Ambiguous         | Due to some other reason or ambiguous factors       |
| **Intentionality**| **Type**          | **Description**                                      |
| Intentional       | Expected Outcome  | Due to an expected outcome from pursuing a goal    |
| Unintentional     | Unexpected Outcome| Due to an unexpected outcome from pursuing a goal  |
| Other            | Unspecified       | Without clearly specifying the intentionality      |
| **Timing**       | **Stage**         | **Description**                                      |
| Pre-deployment   | Before Deployment | Before the AI is deployed                          |
| Post-deployment  | After Deployment  | After the AI model has been trained and deployed   |
| Other           | Unspecified       | Without a clearly specified time of occurrence     |


###### 2.5.1.2.2. Domain Taxonomy

The AI Risk Repository groups risk into 7 major domains, each with subdomains.  This taxonomy was built using experts synthesis of publications on AI risks, with natural language analysis to cluster the topics.  The domains and subdomains are identified in the AI Risk Repository as shown in this table: 


| **Domain**                         | **Subdomain**                                                    |

###### 2.5.1.2.3. Ongoing Monitoring and Integrations

The approach to create the AI Risk Repository used published data to drive the groupings, collecting a large body of information on AI Risks and determining the repeated themes.  The AI Risk Repository framework was updated in December 2024 to map additional risk frameworks or taxonomies to the AI Risk Repository, including a number of 2024 publications from leading groups on AI safety.  Regular updates such as this are required to keep frameworks applicable in a changing technological landscape.

The AI Risk Repository is mapped to the AI Incident Database, an open public repository for indexing harms or near-harms from AI systems.  The AI Risk Repository promotes a side project, the AI Incident Tracker, that maps new incidents added to the AI Incident Database to the AI Risk Repository.  This approach grounds theoretical risks with real incidents, and provides an extensible methodology to incorporate new information.

The Paris Peace Forum selected the AI Risk Repository as one the of 50 AI Projects they will promote at the 2025 AI Action Summit.  The AI Risk Repository will inform more policy makers, auditors, and AI technologists promoted in this way, and its adoption is likely to increase across the global audience.


##### 2.5.1.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

The AI Risk Repository implications for Industry states: "As shown in our causal analysis, many risks are presented as being about AI, while in reality the mitigation of these risks requires a human doing something differently during conceptualisation, design, development, governance, or use."  While the guidance provided does indicate many mitigations to human caused risks for AI, there is little specifically informing defenders of AI systems.

Key items that would help inform defenders of AI systems about risks include:
+ A threat model that shows increased risks from attacks on AI systems
+ Decomposing AI systems into reference architectures
  + Vulnerabilities are rarely 'system' vulnerabilities, and often apply to a component
  + SPM decomposes systems to ensure their security
  + ZTA decomposes systems to ensure their security

### 2.6. OCSF

#### 2.6.1. Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)

##### 2.6.1.1. Overview

The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) is an open-source, vendor-neutral framework designed to standardize security event data across various security products. It was created to address inconsistent log formats, interoperability issues, and complex security analytics caused by disparate security data sources. 

The cybersecurity landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with organizations leveraging multiple security tools, platforms, and technologies to detect, analyze, and respond to threats. However, a lack of standardization in security event data formats has led to significant challenges:

+ ***Inconsistent Log Formats:*** Different security tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR, NDR, IDS, SOAR) generate logs in proprietary formats, making correlation complex.
+ ***Data Silos:*** Security analysts must normalize and map logs manually, delaying threat detection and response.
+ ***High Integration Costs:*** Organizations spend millions of dollars on custom connectors and ETL pipelines to unify data.
+ ***Limited Automation:*** Disparate data structures make it difficult for AI/ML models to detect anomalies efficiently.

The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) directly addresses these issues by providing a standardized, vendor-neutral schema for cybersecurity event data.

###### 2.6.1.2.1. Architectural Design of OCSF

OCSF is structured into three primary layers: **Data Model Layer, Processing Layer, and Consumption Layer**, each playing a critical role in standardizing cybersecurity event data.

| **Layer**           | **Description**                                                                                     | **Key Components**                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Model Layer** | Defines the **core event schema** and organizes event data into structured formats.               | - **Event Classes** (e.g., Authentication, Network Traffic) <br> - **Categories** (logical grouping of events) <br> - **Profiles** (contextual attributes) <br> - **Extensions** (custom attributes & event types) |
| **Processing Layer** | Manages data ingestion, validation, and transformation processes.                                | - **Event Mapping** (translates raw logs to OCSF format) <br> - **Validation Engine** (ensures schema compliance) <br> - **Event Enrichment** (adds contextual data via profiles) |
| **Consumption Layer** | Enables security teams to analyze, correlate, and automate security events using OCSF-standardized data. | - **Threat Detection & Response** (SIEM, XDR, SOAR) <br> - **Incident Investigation & Forensics** <br> - **Threat Intelligence Correlation** <br> - **Security Automation & AI-driven Analytics** |

###### 2.6.1.2.2. Key Features of OCSF


OCSF introduces several key features that enhance security data interoperability, threat detection, and automation.

| **Feature**                  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema-Agnostic & Extensible** | Works with any storage format (JSON, Parquet, Syslog, etc.) and supports custom extensions.  |
| **Structured Taxonomy**       | Organizes security events into well-defined categories, event classes, and profiles.     |
| **Interoperability**          | Enables seamless integration across SIEM, SOAR, XDR, and cloud security platforms.        |
| **Improved Threat Detection** | Provides structured event attributes that enhance threat correlation & automation.   |
| **Lower Operational Costs**   | Reduces the need for custom log parsers and data transformation pipelines.                |
| **Supports Compliance & Regulations** | Aligns with NIST, ISO 27001, MITRE ATT&CK, and CIS Controls for standardized compliance reporting. |

###### 2.6.1.2.3. Structured Taxonomy of OCSF

OCSF organizes security event data into six key constructs, ensuring structured classification, extensibility, and interoperability.

| **Construct**          | **Description**                                                                               | **Example Usage** |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Data Types & Attributes** | Defines primitive (strings, integers, timestamps) and complex (User, Process, Device) data types. | `IP Address`, `MAC Address`, `Timestamp`, `Process Name` |
| **Objects**           | Represents structured collections of attributes that define entities involved in an event. | `User`, `Process`, `Device`, `Network Connection` |
| **Event Classes**      | Represents specific types of security events. Each class has a unique identifier.         | `Authentication`, `File Access`, `Network Connection` |
| **Categories**         | Groups event classes into logical security domains for organization and searchability.    | `System Activity`, `Findings`, `IAM`, `Network Activity` |
| **Profiles**          | Overlays additional attributes to enrich event data with context.                         | `Malware Detection Profile`, `Cloud Profile` |
| **Extensions**        | Allows customization by adding new attributes, event classes, or categories without modifying the core schema. | Custom `IoT Security Events`, `Industry-Specific Threat Indicators` |



##### 2.6.1.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

While OCSF (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework) provides a structured way to standardize security event data, it currently lacks specific provisions for AI system defenders. AI-driven cybersecurity solutions require specialized telemetry, threat models, and security controls that are not fully addressed in OCSF. OCSF needs enhancements to support AI system defenders, focusing on AI-specific threat detection, logging, and governance. This table outlines key gaps, issues, and potential solutions.

| **Category**  | **Issue**   | **Potential Solution**     |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **AI-Specific Threat Event Categories** | Lacks event classes for AI security threats (e.g., data poisoning, model evasion, adversarial ML). | 1. Introduce AI-Specific Event Classes in OCSF. <br> 2. Align with MITRE ATLAS for adversarial ML threats. |
| **AI Logging & Telemetry**            | No standard way to log AI security events (e.g., model drift, inference anomalies, training data integrity). | 1. Extend OCSF attribute dictionary to include AI telemetry. <br> 2. Define structured logs for AI model access & modifications. |
| **AI Threat Intelligence & IOCs**     | No support for AI-specific threat intelligence feeds, such as adversarial samples, model scraping, or model inversion attacks. | 1. Introduce AI-related threat intelligence fields. <br> 2. Integrate with MITRE ATLAS and AI-specific IOCs. |

### 2.7. OWASP


#### 2.7.1. Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025


##### 2.7.1.1. Overview

The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025) highlights critical security risks associated with large language model (LLM) applications, emphasizing threats that can compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As name of this paper emplies, it is focusing on top 10 risks:

1. ***Prompt injection*** remains a major concern, allowing attackers to manipulate LLM behavior and bypass safety controls. 
2. ***Sensitive information disclosure*** can lead to unintended exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and proprietary data. 
3. ***Supply chain risks*** introduce vulnerabilities from third-party models, datasets, and dependencies, making rigorous vetting essential. 
4. ***Insecure output handling*** poses risks of code injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) if LLM-generated content is not properly sanitized. 
5. ***Excessive agency***, where LLMs have unchecked permissions, can lead to unauthorized actions and security breaches. 
6. ***Unbounded resource consumption*** (denial-of-service attacks) can overwhelm systems through excessive query loads, requiring rate limiting and anomaly detection. 
7. ***Data poisoning*** threatens model integrity by injecting manipulated training data, leading to biased or malicious outputs. 
8. ***System prompt leakage*** can expose internal logic, enabling attackers to reverse-engineer security mechanisms. 
9. ***Overly permissive integrations*** pose risks when LLMs are granted excessive API access, increasing the attack surface. 
10. ***Model theft and extraction attacks*** threaten intellectual property by leveraging repeated queries to reconstruct model behavior. 

To mitigate these risks, organizations must enforce strong input/output validation, least privilege principles, robust authentication, adversarial testing, continuous monitoring, and AI-specific security controls to safeguard LLM applications from evolving threats.

#### 2.8.1. The AWS Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix


##### 2.8.1.1. Overview

The AWS Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix is a comprehensive framework developed to help organizations navigate the complex landscape of generative AI security. This structured approach categorizes AI implementations based on the level of control and ownership an organization has over their AI solutions, ranging from using public services to developing custom AI models from scratch. The matrix serves as a guide for identifying appropriate security measures, governance requirements, and risk management strategies that can vary based on the specific implementation scope. It provides organizations with a systematic way to assess their security needs and responsibilities while offering flexibility to adapt to various use cases across different industries and applications.

The AWS Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix docuements 5 scopes of AI applications based on defining the followoing model use cases (aka - "scopes"):
1. Consumer App
2. Enterprise App
3. Pre-built model 
4. Fine-tuned model
5. Self-trained model

<br><br>

###### 2.8.1.1.1. Scoping of AI system and/or cybersecurity purview

<br><br>

###### 2.8.1.1.3. Guidance provided

The AWS Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix helps defenders identify and implement appropriate security controls by providing a structured framework that aligns security measures with the organization's level of control over their AI implementation, from using public AI services to developing custom models.


| **Category**       | **Guidance** |
|--------------------|--------------|
| ***Shared Responsibility Model*** | The matrix clarifies the division of security responsibilities between the organization and the service provider. This varies significantly across the five scopes, from minimal organizational responsibility in Scope 1 (Consumer Apps) to full responsibility in Scope 5 (Self-trained Models). Understanding this division is crucial for ensuring comprehensive security coverage without gaps or redundancies. |
| ***Scope-Based Security Controls*** | Security measures should be tailored to the specific implementation scope. The matrix outlines different security considerations for each scope, ranging from basic data protection and user management in Scope 1 to comprehensive model security, training data protection, and infrastructure security in Scope 5. This approach ensures that security investments are proportional to the complexity and risk level of the AI implementation. |
| ***Scope-Based Risk Management*** | Each scope in the matrix presents distinct security challenges and risk profiles that require specific attention. Rather than viewing security as a progressive implementation, organizations should focus on addressing the unique risk characteristics of their chosen scope. This approach ensures that security measures are optimized for the specific implementation model, whether it's managing API access in Scope 2 or protecting proprietary model architectures in Scope 5. |
| ***Balancing Security and Functionality*** | The framework emphasizes the need to balance robust security with operational efficiency and innovation. It provides guidance on implementing security controls that protect AI systems without unduly hindering their functionality or performance. This balance is particularly crucial in higher scopes where organizations have more control but also face greater security challenges. |
| ***Lifecycle Security Approach*** | The matrix advocates for a comprehensive security approach that covers the entire lifecycle of AI systems. This includes securing data ingestion, model training, deployment, and ongoing operations. By addressing security at each stage, organizations can build a more resilient and trustworthy AI ecosystem, regardless of their implementation scope. |


<br><br>

##### 2.8.1.2. Detail on current framework

The matrix defines five distinct scopes:

***Scope 1: Consumer App***
At Scope 1, organizations utilize publicly available generative AI services through their standard interfaces or APIs, such as general-purpose chatbots or image generators. In this most basic implementation level, users have no visibility into or control over the underlying model or its training data. The organization simply consumes the service as-is, bound by the provider's terms of service and usage restrictions. This approach offers the lowest barrier to entry but also provides minimal customization options and control over security measures. It's typically suited for non-critical use cases where organizational data sensitivity is low and the focus is primarily on managing user interactions and output filtering.

***Scope 2: Enterprise App***
At Scope 2, organizations use enterprise-grade versions of applications that contain AI services that allow for private data handling and enhanced security controls. While still utilizing pre-built models, these implementations include additional layers of protection through managed services, such as enterprise API endpoints with authentication and data handling controls, and typically can include enterprise agreements and legal commitments. Organizations at this scope can integrate the AI service with their existing security infrastructure and maintain better control over data privacy and governance. This approach balances the convenience of managed services with the need for enterprise-grade security, making it suitable for business applications that require protected data handling while still leveraging the efficiency of pre-built models.

***Scope 3: Pre-trained Models***
At Scope 3, organizations create custom applications by leveraging existing foundation models through managed API services, typically when an organization wants to consume a model within an application it is building. This approach enables deeper integration with organizational systems and allows for enhanced functionality through techniques like RAG, which combines the power of foundation models with proprietary data. While the core model remains unchanged, organizations can significantly customize the AI's behavior and responses through sophisticated prompting and context management. This implementation provides greater control over the application layer while maintaining the efficiency of using established foundation models, making it ideal for organizations that need tailored AI solutions but don't require model-level modifications.

***Scope 4: Fine-tuned Models***
At Scope 4, organizations take a significant step beyond basic model usage by fine-tuning existing foundation models with domain-specific data. This approach creates a specialized version of the base model that's optimized for particular use cases and organizational needs. The organization gains control over both the fine-tuning process and the resulting model, enabling more precise and contextually appropriate outputs. This implementation level requires deeper technical expertise and careful management of training data, but offers substantially improved performance for specialized tasks. While building upon established model architectures, this scope provides organizations with the ability to create truly customized AI solutions that align closely with specific industry requirements and professional standards.

***Scope 5: Self-trained models***
At Scope 5, organizations undertake the most comprehensive level of AI development by creating and training models entirely from scratch. This represents complete ownership and control over every aspect of the AI system, from architecture design to model training and deployment. Organizations at this scope have full authority over the entire AI stack, enabling them to develop novel solutions that may not be possible with existing models. This approach requires the highest level of technical expertise and computational resources, but offers unparalleled flexibility and potential for innovation. Such implementations are typically pursued when organizations aim to develop proprietary AI technology that can serve as a competitive advantage or commercial product in itself.

As organizations progress from Scope 1 to Scope 5, they experience an increase in the level of control and customization over their AI solutions. This progression also brings greater security responsibilities and complexities. For each scope that an organization adopts, the matrix can help prioritize different security measures and risk management strategies unique to each scope.

The matrix serves as a valuable tool for organizations in several ways. It enables them to assess their current and planned AI implementations accurately, identifying relevant security disciplines for each scope. This assessment helps in prioritizing security efforts based on the specific risk profile of each implementation. Furthermore, the matrix guides organizations in making informed decisions about how security controls may differ when you are buying AI solutions or building them, allowing them to scale their security measures effectively as their AI implementations evolve. 


##### 2.8.1.3. What is missing for defenders of AI systems

The AWS Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix provides deferenders with a framework and mental model that enables them to more quickly assess the risks associated with various AI systems based on unique scopes of each AI system use case, and the security controls necessary to help mitigate and compensate for those risks.  As a result, it provides broad guidance and approaches organizations can take to understand where to focus their efforts, but it does not provide low level implementation details necessary to implement specific security controls.  Organizations will need to leverage this framework, along with others, to help ensure a comprehensive security control strategy.
